# Encryption-Decryption-using-RSA

Hey everyone this was my minor project which I build with my teammates using tkinter module

To run this project download these three files on your computer and run main.py 

It will open an interface asking to enter your choice. 

If you enter your choice as 1, it will generate the keys for your encryption and decryption and store it in a file called output.txt

If you enter your choice as 2 , it will open another interface asking if you want to encrypt the data or decrypt the data 

If you enter 1 , it will ask you to enter encryption key and value of N which you can see in your output.txt. Enter your msg and click on encrypte. Your data is encrypted now.

To decrypte the data, enter your choice as 2 and again enter all the keys and your msg. Click on decrypte and your data is now decrypted

Everytime you run your program and click on generate key , it will genrate different key 

But remember , to decrypte the data you need to enter same encryption , N and decryption key which was used for encryption If you try to decrypte the data with newly  generated key it will show you error.
